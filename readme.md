# titanium-streams-demo

> Titanium demo app for using AMPLIFY Streams

The initial version of the demo app simply captures the data/patches and outputs them to the console.   It also uses `json-fast-patch` to patch the original document with the update and output that to the console as well.

** **Update** **

The screen is now updated with data from one of APIs.  Check it out!
